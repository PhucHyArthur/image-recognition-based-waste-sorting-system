# PROJECT: AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE

In this project, we will develop a system to recognize and interpret American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks along with the MediaPipe framework, a powerful tool for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.

## Overview

American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, complex language that employs signs made by moving the hands, facial expressions, and body postures. By combining LSTM networks with MediaPipe's hand tracking capabilities, we can build a system to interpret ASL gestures in real-time, facilitating communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Features


## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as OpenCV, Meidapipe, scikit-learn, and any other dependencies required for image processing and machine learning tasks.
2. Data Preparation, ensure that you have the correct path. 
3. Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed dataset.
